# ðŸ‘¼ HolyUtils: Unix Commands in HolyC
***(Just a meme)***

A collection of recreated Unix commands implemented in HolyC. This project aims to provide familiar Unix utilities for TempleOS environments.

## About

This project is inspired by [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), a cross-platform reimplementation of GNU coreutils in Rust. HolyUtils aims to provide similar functionality but in HolyC for TempleOS and TempleOS-like environments.

### Disclaimer

HolyUtils is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with GNU, uutils, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. The name "HolyUtils" is used for descriptive purposes only. All Unix command names and their functionality are recreated independently for TempleOS environments.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- HolyC compiler (hcc)
- Make
- TempleOS or compatible environment

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HolyUtils.git
   cd HolyUtils
   ```

2. Build all utilities:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will create a `dist/` directory containing all compiled utilities.

3. Optional: Install utilities system-wide (requires root):
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

### Makefile Targets

- `make` or `make all`: Build all utilities in the `dist/` directory
- `make clean`: Remove the `dist/` directory and all build artifacts
- `make install`: Install utilities to `/usr/local/bin/` (requires root)
- `make uninstall`: Remove utilities from `/usr/local/bin/` (requires root)

### Building Individual Utilities

To build a specific utility, you can use:
```bash
make dist/utility_name
```
For example:
```bash
make dist/ls
```

## Available Commands

### alias

The `alias` command allows users to create command aliases, similar to the Unix equivalent.

#### Usage
```
alias [name[='value']] [-help]
alias -r name

### echo

The `echo` command displays a line of text.

#### Features
- Display text with or without newline (-n)
- Enable interpretation of backslash escapes (-e)
- Disable interpretation of backslash escapes (-E)
- Support for various escape sequences (\n, \t, \r, etc.)
- Support for octal and hexadecimal escape sequences

#### Usage
```
echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...
```

### printf

The `printf` command formats and prints data.

#### Features

- Support for width and precision
- Left-justification (-)
- Sign display (+)
- Space padding
- Zero padding (0)
- Alternate form (#)
- Support for integers, strings, characters, and pointers

### wc

The `wc` command counts lines, words, and bytes in files.

#### Features
- Count lines (-l)
- Count words (-w)
- Count bytes (-c)
- Print maximum line length (-L)
- Support for multiple files

## Implementation Details

Each command is implemented as a standalone HolyC file that can be included and used independently. Commands store their state in memory and are not persisted between sessions by default.

## Building and Running

The command files can be compiled and run in the TempleOS environment or any compatible HolyC compiler.

## Future Commands

Additional Unix commands may be added to this collection over time.
